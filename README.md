# 🌐 My Portfolio Website

This is my **first personal portfolio website**, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
I created it by following tutorials from **Miladicode**, and through this process, 
I’ve learned a lot about how these core web technologies interact and are structured.

## 💡 What I Learned

- Basic to intermediate **HTML structure** and semantics
- Styling using **CSS** (including layouts and gradients)
- Adding interactivity using **JavaScript**
- How these three technologies work together to build responsive websites

## 🎯 My Mission

This is just the beginning!  
I aim to **update and improve this portfolio every year** as I grow in my professional and personal development. 
Each version will reflect my latest skills, projects, and goals.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- VS Code for development
- GitHub Pages for deployment
