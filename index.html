                        Graduated from the Polytechnic University of the Philippines with a Bachelor of Science in Electronics and Communications Engineering, and recently passed the ECE and ECT licensure examinations in April.
                        I'm eager to explore the dynamic and ever-evolving tech landscape.
                        Currently diving into software development, cloud computing, AI/ML, and data engineering driven by curiosity and a passion to create something wonderful.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        My tech stack reflects a blend of hardware innovation, 
                        software development, and data handling. I work with Arduino and 
                        Raspberry Pi, using C for embedded systems and sensor-based projects. 
                        On the software side, I primarily use Python to build scripts, automate 
                        tasks, and interact with RESTful APIs, including integrations with the OpenAI 
                        API for AI-driven applications. I’ve strengthened my data skills through DataCamp, 
                        where I learned SQL, data cleaning, and basic data analysis techniques. I manage all 
                        my code using Git and host my projects on GitHub for version control and collaboration. 
                        I’m also comfortable navigating and working in the command line interface.

                        to different time zones and team dynamics. Whether it's 
                        async updates or live collaboration, I prioritize keeping 
                        everyone aligned and connected.
